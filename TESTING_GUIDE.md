# Complete Testing Guide for Stripe Payment Integration

## üéØ Overview
This guide will walk you through testing the entire Stripe payment integration step by step, from initial setup to end-to-end payment processing.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Java 21+ installed
- Maven installed
- PostgreSQL running
- Stripe account (free)
- Stripe CLI (optional, for webhook testing)

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Stripe Account Setup

### 1.1 Create Stripe Account
1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Click "Start now" and create a free account
3. Complete the basic setup (no credit card required for testing)

### 1.2 Get API Keys
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí API keys
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
3. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
4. Keep these keys safe - you'll need them for testing

### 1.3 Set Up Webhook (Optional for Local Testing)
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. For local testing, you can skip this step initially
4. For production: Add `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Application Configuration

### 2.1 Add Stripe Properties
Add these lines to your `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# Stripe Configuration
stripe.secret.key=sk_test_your_actual_secret_key_here
stripe.webhook.secret=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

**Replace with your actual keys from Step 1.2**

### 2.2 Verify Database Configuration
Ensure your database is running and the application can connect:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/coachera
spring.datasource.username=coachera
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step 3: Start the Application

### 3.1 Build and Run
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/mega/projects/Spring/Coachera

# Clean and build the project
mvn clean install

# Start the application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3.2 Verify Application Started
1. Check the console output for any errors
2. Look for: "Started CoacheraApplication in X seconds"
3. The application should be running on `http://localhost:8080`

### 3.3 Check Database Tables
The `payments` table should be automatically created. You can verify this by:
1. Connecting to your PostgreSQL database
2. Running: `\dt payments;` (should show the payments table)

---

## üß™ Step 4: Create Test Data

### 4.1 Create a Test User (Student)
First, you need to register a user and create a student profile. Use your existing registration endpoint:

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "teststudent",
    "email": "teststudent@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "student"
  }'
```

### 4.2 Create a Test Course
You'll need a course to purchase. Use your existing course creation endpoint or create one via your application interface.

### 4.3 Login to Get Session
```bash
# Login to get a session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "teststudent",
    "password": "password123"
  }' \
  -c cookies.txt
```

**Save the session cookie for subsequent requests.**

---

## üí≥ Step 5: Test Payment Creation

### 5.1 Create a Payment Intent
```bash
# Create a payment intent for course purchase
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "courseId": 1,
    "amount": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "description": "Payment for Test Course"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "Payment intent created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "stripePaymentIntentId": "pi_1234567890",
    "clientSecret": "pi_1234567890_secret_abc123",
    "amount": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "description": "Payment for Test Course",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "courseTitle": "Test Course",
    "studentName": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Verify Database Record
Check that the payment was saved to the database:
```bash
# Get payment by ID
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/payments/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

---

## üß™ Step 6: Test Different Payment Scenarios

### 6.1 Test Successful Payment
Use Stripe's test card for successful payments:

**Card Number:** `4242424242424242`
**CVC:** `123`
**Expiry:** `12/25`

### 6.2 Test Failed Payment
Use Stripe's test card for declined payments:

**Card Number:** `4000000000000002`
**CVC:** `123`
**Expiry:** `12/25`

### 6.3 Test Authentication Required
Use Stripe's test card that requires authentication:

**Card Number:** `4000002500003155`
**CVC:** `123`
**Expiry:** `12/25`

---

## üåê Step 7: Frontend Integration Testing

### 7.1 Create a Simple HTML Test Page
Create a file called `payment-test.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Payment Test</title>
    <script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Payment Test</h1>
    
    <form id="payment-form">
        <div id="payment-element"></div>
        <button id="submit">Pay now</button>
        <div id="error-message"></div>
    </form>

    <script>
        // Replace with your publishable key
        const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_your_publishable_key_here');
        
        // Get client secret from your backend
        const clientSecret = 'pi_1234567890_secret_abc123'; // Replace with actual client secret
        
        const elements = stripe.elements({
            clientSecret: clientSecret
        });
        
        const paymentElement = elements.create('payment');
        paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');
        
        const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');
        form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            
            const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({
                elements,
                confirmParams: {
                    return_url: window.location.origin + '/success',
                },
            });
            
            if (error) {
                const messageDiv = document.getElementById('error-message');
                messageDiv.textContent = error.message;
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 7.2 Test Frontend Integration
1. Replace `pk_test_your_publishable_key_here` with your actual publishable key
2. Replace the client secret with the one from your payment intent response
3. Open the HTML file in a browser
4. Test with different card numbers

## üîÑ Step 8: Webhook Testing (Optional)

### 8.1 Install Stripe CLI
```bash
# Download from: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
# Or use package manager:
# macOS: brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
# Windows: scoop install stripe
```

### 8.2 Login to Stripe CLI
```bash
stripe login
```

### 8.3 Forward Webhooks to Local Server
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### 8.4 Test Webhook Events
```bash
# Trigger a test payment succeeded event
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded

# Trigger a test payment failed event
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
```

### 8.5 Verify Webhook Processing
Check your application logs for webhook processing messages:
```bash
tail -f coachera.log
```

---

## üìä Step 9: Payment History Testing

### 9.1 Get User's Payment History
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/payments/my-payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

### 9.2 Get Specific Payment
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/payments/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 9.3 Get Payment by Stripe ID
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/payments/stripe/pi_1234567890 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

---

## üß™ Step 10: Error Handling Testing

### 10.1 Test Invalid Course ID
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "courseId": 999,
    "amount": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'
```

### 10.2 Test Unauthenticated Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "courseId": 1,
    "amount": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'
```

### 10.3 Test Invalid Amount
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments/create-payment-intent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -b cookies.txt \
  -d '{
    "courseId": 1,
    "amount": -10,
    "currency": "USD"
  }'
```
